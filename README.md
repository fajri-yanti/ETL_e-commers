## Project Background
The growth of e-commerce has resulted in a vast amount of data, spanning everything from customer behavior and sales transactions to inventory and logistics information. However, handling these large and varied datasets presents challenges, particularly when trying to extract meaningful insights quickly and efficiently.This project aims to develop a reliable data pipeline utilizing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to simplify and optimize the preparation of e-commerce data for analysis. The objective is to gather raw data from multiple sources, transform it into a well-organized format, and load it into a data warehouse or analytics platform for easy access to reporting, analysis, and decision-making.
