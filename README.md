## Project Background
E-commerce systems in the current digital economy produce enormous volumes of data every day, encompassing a variety of topics like user activity, product listings, sales transactions, and customer interactions. Businesses must manage and analyze data effectively in order to improve  data analysis process. This project focuses on designing and implementing an ETL pipeline specifically for an e-commerce dataset. Extracting data from various sources, converting it into a format that can be used, and then storing it in a data warehouse for additional analysis all depend on the ETL process. Businesses may combine their data using this pipeline, which provides data is clear, organized, and easily accessible for reporting and data-driven decision-making.
